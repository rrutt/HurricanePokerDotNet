Hurricane is two-card draw poker, deuces wild, played as high/low; 
aces, deuces play both high and low.

This is an implementation of the game using C# and Prolog.

The game rules and artificial intelligence engine uses tuProlog (also known as 2p) 
from the University of Bologna.
  
Since tuProlog is written in Java, the IKVM tool set was used to convert the
Java byte code in 2p.jar to a Microsoft .NET MSIL assembly alice.tuprolog.dll.

To run the game, open a command-prompt (terminal) window and navigate to the out sub-folder, 
containing the executable files. 

Enter the following command:
  
    HurricanePoker
