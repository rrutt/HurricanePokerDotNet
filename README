Hurricane is two-card draw poker, deuces wild, played as high/low; 
aces, deuces play both high and low.

This is an implementation of the game using C# and Prolog.
The game rules and artificial intelligence engine uses tuProlog (
also known as 2p) from the University of Bologna.

To run the game, open a command-prompt (terminal) window and navigate to the out sub-folder, 
containing the executable files. 

Enter the following command:
  
    HurricanePoker
